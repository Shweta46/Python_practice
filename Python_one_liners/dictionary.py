# SLICING ASSIGNMENTS: slice assignments.
# Youâ€™ll use slice assignments to select and replace a sequence of elements between # indices i and j by using the slicing notation lst[i:j] = [0 0 ...0]. Because # you are using slicing lst[i:j] on the left-hand side of the assignment operation (rather than on the right-hand side as done previously), the feature is # denoted as slice assignments. The idea of slice assignments is simple: replace all selected elements in the original sequence on the left with the elements on the right.
